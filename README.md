SQL Project Readme
Project Summary
This project focuses on leveraging Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL) to perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes and conduct data analysis on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using a pizza sales database. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the pizza sales business by extracting data, transforming it into meaningful formats, and analyzing KPIs to inform business decisions.

Project Goals
Data Extraction: The project involves extracting relevant data from a pizza sales database, ensuring that the data is up-to-date and accurate. The source data should encompass information such as sales transactions, customer details, product catalog, and more.
Data Transformation: The extracted data needs to be transformed into a format that is conducive to analysis. This includes cleaning, structuring, aggregating, and potentially joining multiple datasets to create a consolidated data source for analysis.
Data Loading: Once the data is transformed, it should be loaded into a SQL Server database, making it readily accessible for analysis. This database serves as the foundation for conducting KPI-driven analyses.
KPI Analysis: Using MS SQL, the project conducts data analysis to derive Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are essential for evaluating the pizza sales business. These KPIs could include metrics like sales revenue, profit margins, customer retention rates, product popularity, and more.

Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

Microsoft SQL Server: The core database engine for data storage and analysis.
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): A tool for writing and executing SQL queries.
Data Integration Tools (if applicable): Tools like SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) may be used for ETL processes.

Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

Ensure that Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio are installed.
Clone or download the project repository.
Run the SQL scripts to perform ETL processes, create the necessary database schema, and analyze KPIs.

Conclusion
This MS SQL project focuses on extracting, transforming, loading, and analyzing data from a pizza sales database to derive essential Key Performance Indicators. By following the provided documentation, stakeholders can harness the insights gained from this project to make data-driven decisions and enhance the performance of the pizza sales business.
